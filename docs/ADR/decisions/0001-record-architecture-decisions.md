## Context

To ensure transparency and documentation of architectural decisions in the Music Manager project, it is necessary to implement a formalized process for recording such decisions. This will help preserve the history of made decisions and their justification.

## Decision

It was decided to use the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) format for documenting architectural decisions. Each decision will be recorded as a separate file with a clear structure:

### ADR Structure:
1. **Header and metadata**
   - Unique number (NNNN-title.md)
   - Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
   - Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Author

2. **Main content**
   - Context: Description of the problem and context
   - Decision: Detailed decision with justification
   - Consequences: Direct consequences of the decision
   - Improvements: Potential improvements

### Writing rules:
- Each ADR should describe one specific decision
- Use clear and concrete formulations
- Provide implementation examples where appropriate
- Indicate connections with other ADRs

## Consequences
- Transparency in the decision-making process
- Documentation of decision justification
- Easy tracking of change history
- Simplified onboarding for new developers
- Ability to review and reassess decisions
- Additional time costs for documentation
- Need to maintain documentation relevance

## Improvements
- Automation of the ADR creation process
- Integration with version control system
- Implementation of regular ADR review (quarterly)
