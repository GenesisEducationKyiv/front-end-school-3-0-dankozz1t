- **Status:** Accepted

## Context

For Music Manager, we need to choose a state management solution that will provide:
- Centralized data management
- State typing
- Easy testing
- Good performance
- Easy integration with Vue 3

## Decision

It was decided to use Pinia for centralized state management in the application. Choice justification:

1. **Pinia advantages**
   - Simpler API compared to Vuex
   - Better integration with Vue 3 and Composition API
   - Excellent TypeScript support
   - Modular architecture out of the box
   - Less boilerplate code

2. **Comparison with alternatives**
   - Redux: more complex API, more code, not native for Vue
   - Vuex: outdated API, worse integration with Composition API
   - MobX: excessive complexity for our needs

3. **Technical advantages**
   - Built-in DevTools support
   - Easy testing
   - Good documentation
   - Active community

## Consequences
- Simple development and maintenance process
- Easy state management scaling
- Effective work with TypeScript
- Convenient store testing
- Good performance
- Fewer ready-made solutions for edge-cases compared to Redux

## Improvements
- Creating templates for typical stores
- Developing utilities to simplify working with Pinia
- Documenting best practices
